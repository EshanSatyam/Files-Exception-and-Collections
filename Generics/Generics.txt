Generics


--- Generics means parameterized types. The idea is to allow type (Integer, String, â€¦ etc., 
and user-defined types) to be a parameter to methods, classes, and interfaces. Using Generics, 
it is possible to create classes that work with different data types. An entity such as class,
 interface, or method that operates on a parameterized type is a generic entity. 

   Types of Java Generics

   1.Generic Method: Generic Java method takes a parameter and returns some value after performing a task. 
   It is exactly like a normal function, however, a generic method has type parameters that are cited 
   by actual type.

   2.Generic Classes: A generic class is implemented exactly like a non-generic class. 
   The only difference is that it contains a type parameter section. There can be more than one type of 
   parameter, separated by a comma.
